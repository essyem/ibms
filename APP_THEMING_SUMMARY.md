```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Finance App Testing

- Test hover effects on cards and buttons

### 2. Procurement App Testing  
- Navigate to procurement pages
- Verify large industrial-style navbar
- Check green theme and larger typography
- Verify QAR currency in procurement dashboard

### 3. Invoice App Testing
- Navigate to invoice pages
- Verify professional blue theme
- Check that invoice amounts display QAR
- Test invoice status styling

### 4. Reports App Testing

## Implementation Notes

1. **Template Inheritance:** Each app now has its own base template that extends the main `base.html`
2. **CSS Isolation:** Each theme is self-contained with CSS custom properties
3. **Responsive Design:** All themes include mobile-responsive breakpoints
4. **Currency Consistency:** QAR is now used throughout the application
5. **Animation Effects:** Each theme includes unique hover and transition effects

## Next Steps
1. Test each module thoroughly in the browser
2. Verify responsive behavior on mobile devices
3. Check for any remaining $ symbols in the application
4. Validate that all forms and admin panels display correctly
5. Test printing functionality with new themes

The implementation provides unique visual identity for each app while maintaining consistent QAR currency formatting throughout the entire application.
