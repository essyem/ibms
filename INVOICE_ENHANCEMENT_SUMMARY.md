# Invoice System Enhancement Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ **Product Search Styling Fixed**
- **Problem**: Product search results were showing white backgrounds instead of blue theme
- **Solution**: Updated JavaScript to use CSS classes and theme colors
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `static/portal/js/invoice_create_unified.js` - Removed hardcoded light colors
  - `templates/portal/invoice_edit.html` - Added product search results CSS styling

### 2. ✅ **Sales Tracking System Created**
- **Problem**: No tracking of sold items without reducing inventory stock
- **Solution**: Created `SoldItem` model to track sales separately from inventory
- **Features**:
  - Tracks product name, quantity, unit price at time of sale
  - Links to original invoice and product (with null protection)
  - Includes SKU and category for better reporting
  - Auto-populated when invoice status changes to 'paid'

### 3. ✅ **Automatic Sales Recording via Signals**
- **Problem**: Manual tracking of sales was needed
- **Solution**: Django signals automatically create SoldItem records
- **Files Created**: 
  - `portal/signals.py` - Signal handlers for invoice status changes
  - Updated `portal/apps.py` - Auto-load signals
- **Functionality**:
  - When invoice status changes to 'paid', automatically creates SoldItem records
  - Prevents duplicate records for same invoice
  - Comprehensive logging for tracking

### 4. ✅ **Unit Price Override System**
- **Problem**: Unit prices always fetched from product master, couldn't be customized
- **Solution**: Added `use_product_price` field and checkbox controls
- **Features**:
  - Checkbox to toggle between product price and custom price
  - When checked: Uses product price (readonly)
  - When unchecked: Allows manual price editing
  - JavaScript handles the interface seamlessly

### 5. ✅ **Admin Interface for Sales Reports**
- **Problem**: No way to view sold items and sales data
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive SoldItemAdmin
- **Features**:
  - Read-only view (prevents manual editing of sales records)
  - Filterable by date, category, product name
  - Searchable by product, SKU, invoice number, customer
  - Shows subtotal calculations in QAR
  - Links to invoice and customer information

## How It Works

### Sales Flow:
1. **Create Invoice**: Add products with either product price or custom price
2. **Invoice Payment**: When invoice status changes to 'paid'
3. **Auto-Recording**: Signal automatically creates SoldItem records
4. **Inventory Separation**: Product stock remains unchanged
5. **Sales Reporting**: View sold items in admin interface

### Price Override:
1. **Select Product**: Choose product from search or dropdown
2. **Default Price**: System shows product's unit price
3. **Override Option**: Checkbox appears "Use product price (QAR X.XX)"
4. **Custom Price**: Uncheck to enable manual price editing
5. **Flexibility**: Each line item can have different pricing approach

### Sales Tracking:
1. **No Stock Reduction**: Product inventory never decreases
2. **Historical Records**: SoldItem tracks what was actually sold
3. **Reporting**: Admin interface shows comprehensive sales data
4. **Audit Trail**: Links to original invoice and product

## Database Changes

### New Model: SoldItem
```python
- invoice (FK to Invoice)
- product_name (CharField) - Name at time of sale
- quantity (PositiveIntegerField)
- unit_price (DecimalField)

### Modified Model: InvoiceItem
